## Project 1: [Data modeling with PostgreSQL](https://github.com/riched158/UdacityDataEngineering/tree/master/datamodelling/project1)

Model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. Create a relational database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. In PostgreSQL define Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into the new tables.


## Project 2: [Data modeling with Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/riched158/UdacityDataEngineering/tree/master/datamodelling/project2)

Model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. Create a noSQL database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. Model your data in Apache Cassandra to allow for specific queries provided by the analytics team at Sparkify.

Concepts: Data Modelling, Relational Data Models, NoSQL Data models

## Project 3: [Build a Cloud Data Warehouse](https://github.com/riched158/UdacityDataEngineering/tree/master/datawarehouse/project3)

Building on previous projects, build an ETL pipeline that extracts song data data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

Concepts: Data Warehouses, Cloud Computing with AWS, Implementing Data Warehouses on AWS
